Thing that puts many small groupings of words into a single huge grouping of words.

_(Written using only the ten hundred words people use the most often, as stated by [the computer place with funny black and white drawings](https://xkcd.com/simplewriter))_

Today, there are a lot of big words used to explain things that could be understood by a larger group of people if simpler words were used instead. 

When I write I often fall into this situation myself. It's often easier to use the single big hairy word rather than several smaller, but easier to understand words. These and the following words try to explain something using only the ten hundred most often used words.

Every day, hundreds of hundreds of people visit pages on computers all around the world. These people want these pages to work quickly. This usually means saving as few things as possible when they visit a page. However, if you are the person that works on these pages and puts word into a computer all day that's probably not how you want to write those words.

When writing and working on those words on the computer, you want probably would rather have many small groupings of words. This way it's easier to keep everything in your head when working on it. If every single word was in one grouping, it would be very hard to keep it all in your head. If other people are also making changes at the same time it can be hard to put those together if it's all in one spot. By having many different word groupings, another person is probably not also making changes in the same spot.

For a computer place with many pages, there might be hundreds and hundreds of word groupings. But if a person on the other side of the world wants to visit this page, it would take a long time to save all of these different word groupings. 

The people who write these words want to work with many small word groupings, but the people that view these pages want to save only a few large word groupings. So how do we get from hundreds and hundreds of word groupings into only a few groupings of words? 

**The thing that puts different groupings of words into a single grouping of words.** For short, we'll call it the "Word Grouper."

But this sounds really hard to do. How does it work?

## Starting Point

To start, the thing itself needs a place to start. That's the starting point.

It's possible to have more than one starting point but that's usually not needed. This starting point is where everything starts. The Word Grouper finds all of the other word groupings that the starting point needs. Then the word groupings those word groups need and so on. As the Word Grouper jumps around it can then build a huge map of which word groupings need which word groupings. This can be any number of layers deep and by the finish point, it may have found hundreds of hundreds of word groupings.

## Finish Point

Once the Word Grouper finishes building a huge map of all the word groupings it can then use the map to put all the different word groupings into a single big word grouping.

When it's done figuring this out, it then saves this finishing point and this is what people all around the world will then save on their computer when they visit.

To quickly go over, it starts with one word grouping, finds all the other word groupings, and then ends with a single huge grouping of words.

However, it's doing a lot of other things between the starting point and finish point.

## Word Understanders

As the Word Grouper jumps around between word groupings, it might find different kinds of word groupings. There can be any number of different kinds of word groupings, but there are a few that show up often:

- Words that run on the person's computer.
- Words that make things look pretty.
- Words that show pictures.
- Words that change the way the real words appear when reading.

These are only a few, there are many more. How is the Word Grouper supposed to understand so many different things? 

The short answer: it doesn't! Instead, it uses Word Understanders. Each different kind of word grouping has a special Word Understander that knows how to understand only that kind of word grouping. When using the Word Grouper, you can add as many Word Understanders as you want!

If you need to run words, then a Running Word Understander is added. If you need to make things look pretty, then a Pretty Word Understander is added. If you need to show pictures, then a Picture Word Understander is added. 

## Word Changers

Once the words are understood, you sometimes want to change, add or remove words. Word Changers can be used to change one word for another, remove extra words and make them smaller, or move words to another spot.

## Word Grouper Work Size

There are different work sizes you can use to control how much work the Word Grouper, Understander, and Changers do.

Changing the words a lot usually takes a lot more time to run, but it usually means fewer words for the person on the other side of the world to save so it's faster for them. Changing the words less means it runs faster but takes longer for the person to save. 

This means when you're working on the words and making a lot of changes, you want to make fewer changes to the words. This means it's faster for you to make a lot of changes quickly. Then, when you are ready to share it with the world, you make a lot of word changes because you only have to do this once in a while and means the hundreds and hundreds of people that need to save the word grouping will be able to do so quickly.
