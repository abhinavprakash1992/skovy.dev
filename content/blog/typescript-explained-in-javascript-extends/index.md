This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> post in the series "TypeScript explained in
JavaScript."

The first post [covered the `keyof` operator](/typescript-explained-in-javascript-keyof/)
and I would recommend starting there if you haven't. In that post, the `extends`
keyword was used to demonstrate one of the uses for the `keyof` operator. This
post will cover the `extends` keyword in more depth.

## JavaScript

JavaScript has supported the
[`extends`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/extends)
keyword with class declarations since ES6. It can be used to create a subclass
or child class of another class.

For example, let's say we create a simple `Book` class to represent the concept
of a book.

```javascript
class Book {
  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title;
  }
}
```

This `Book` class accepts a book's title when it's instantiated. For example,
we can instantiate a class for the book "The Phoenix Project."

```javascript
const book = new Book("The Phoenix Project");
```

Now, say we want to not only represent a book, but also the concept of an audio
book. You could say an audio book is an _extension_ of a book. It still has a
title, but it also has a total duration; the length of time it takes to listen
to the entire audio book.

```javascript
class AudioBook extends Book {
  constructor(title, duration) {
    super(title);
    this.duration = duration;
  }

  describe() {
    return `"${this.title}" is ${this.duration} minutes`;
  }
}
```

This `AudioBook` class not only accepts a book's title, but also the total
duration. To demonstrate a bit more functionality, a method was also
added to quickly describe the book. For example, we can instantiate a class for
the audio book "Educated: A Memoir" and denote that it is 12 hours and 11 minutes
long _(or 731 minutes)_.

```javascript
const book = new AudioBook("Educated: A Memoir", 731);
console.log(book.describe()); // "Educated: A Memoir" is 731 minutes
```

We may also consider creating an `EBook` class to represent digital books that
could be read on tablets.

In this context, the `extends` keyword is useful in JavaScript when one concept
needs to be applied to another and they need to remain consistent. For example,
now if the `author` is added to the `Book` class, it can be easily adapted to the
`AudioBook` class.

## TypeScript

How does this apply to TypeScript?

### Classes

The first use case is identical to above. Since TypeScript is a superset of
JavaScript, it also supports usage of the `extends` keyword with class
decelerations. Minus a few missing types, the above code is also valid TypeScript.

However, TypeScript also leverages this concept of "extending" one thing to
another in the type system. Notably, interfaces and generics (as constraints).

### Interfaces

Let's start with interfaces. If we were to create an interface for the `Book`
class from above to implement it would look like the following.

```typescript
interface Book {
  title: string;
}
```

Similarly, we can declare an interface for the `AudioBook` class.

```typescript
interface AudioBook extends Book {
  duration: number;
  describe(): string;
}
```

However, this interface is _extending_ the `Book` interface. This behaves
conceptually the same way as extending a class in JavaScript. The `AudioBook`
interface extends the `Book` interface (inheriting the `title` property) and adds on
two additional properties.

The resulting interface is equivalent to the following.

```typescript
interface AudioBook {
  title: string;
  duration: number;
  describe(): string;
}
```

### Generics and Constraints

One of the other uses for the `extends` keyword in TypeScript is constraints
for generics _(this concept also applies directly to conditional types which
will be covered in an upcoming post in this series)_.

For example, let's say we want to define a `printTitle` function that expects
any type of `Book` (this could also be an `AudioBook` or `EBook`).

```typescript
function printTitle(book: any) {
  console.log(book.title);
}

const book = new Book("The Phoenix Project");
printTitle(book); // The Phoenix Project

const audioBook = new AudioBook("Educated: A Memoir", 731);
printTitle(audioBook); // Educated: A Memoir

printTitle("The Phoenix Project"); // undefined
```

This works mostly as expected. However, the type for `book` is declared as `any`.
This isn't ideal, because the last example is not a valid book. It's passing
in a string directly which doesn't have a `title` property, so it prints
`undefined`. Ideally, this type of issue is caught at compile time, not run
time.

Since this is a "generic" function in the sense that it can accept any
kind of book, let's define a generic `Input` to represent that.

```typescript
function printTitle<Input>(book: Input) {
  console.log(book.title);
}
```

Unfortunately, this isn't valid and we'll see the TypeScript compiler error with:
`Property 'title' does not exist on type 'Input'`. So how do we say that the
generic `Input` type has a `title` property but still allow anything with
additional properties?

We can apply a constraint, or say the `Input` type _must_ extend the `Book`
interface:

```typescript
function printTitle<Input extends Book>(book: Input) {
  console.log(book.title);
}

const book = new Book("The Phoenix Project");
printTitle(book); // The Phoenix Project

const audioBook = new AudioBook("Educated: A Memoir", 731);
printTitle(audioBook); // Educated: A Memoir

printTitle("The Phoenix Project");
// Argument of type '"The Phoenix Project"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Book'
```

This is exactly what we want. The `printTitle` function accepts anything with a
`title` attribute, and now results in a compile time error for invalid usages.

One important thing to note here is that TypeScript relies on types being
[structurally equivalent](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html).
This means that the input to `printTitle` doesn't have to literally `extend Book`,
but rather have the same structure as the `Book` interface. The following
object literal with a `title` property will also be valid:

```typescript
printTitle({ title: "The Phoenix Project" });
```

## Definition

The `extends` keyword has a single behavior (extending things), but it useful in
several contexts:

- [Extending class definitions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html#inheritance)
- [Extending interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html#extending-interfaces)
- [Imposing constraints](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html#generic-constraints)

Interestingly, an [interface can even extend a class](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html#interfaces-extending-classes)! ðŸ¤¯

## Conclusion

In summary, TypeScript's `extends` is equivalent to JavaScript's `extends` when
working with classes. However, TypeScript's `extends` is "overloaded" with
additional functionality that is particularly useful when working with types.

Similar to the `keyof` operator, I would consider `extends` to be a fundamental
building block for some of the more complex and powerful features of TypeScript,
specifically conditional types that will be covered in a future post.
