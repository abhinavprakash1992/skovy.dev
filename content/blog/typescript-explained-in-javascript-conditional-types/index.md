Throughout the course of writing software, it's likely you will eventually have
a need to conditionally return different values from a function depending
on it's input. Or, maybe a second argument that depends on the value of the
first argument. There are plenty of other examples that depend on a specific
value, but that value could be any number of things.

This concept is easy to handle with JavaScript at runtime, but is not as trivial
to strictly type at compile time.

## JavaScript

Let's start with a JavaScript function that accepts an array and allows filtering,
or omitting any values of a specific type.

```javascript
const omitByType = (array, type) =>
  array.filter(value => typeof value !== type);

console.log(omitByType(["a", 10, "b", false, "c"], "boolean")); // ["a", 10, "b", "c"]
console.log(omitByType(["a", 10, "b", false, "c"], "number")); // Â ["a", "b", false, "c"]
console.log(omitByType(["a", 10, "b", false, "c"], "string")); // [10, false]
console.log(omitByType(["a", 10, "b", false, "c"], "object")); // ["a", 10, "b", false, "c"]
```

Each invocation uses the same input, but changes the second argument. In each
case, values of that type are filtered out. So the first case no longer contains
`false` because it's a `boolean`. The second no longer contains `10` because
it's a `number`, and the third case no longer contains `"a"`, `"b"`, or `"c"`
since they are all a `string`. The last case returns the same values since
none of them are an `object`.

This last case starts show the value of providing strict types. Should `"object"`
be allowed if it's known not to contain any objects? How would this constraint
be reflected in the type system?

## TypeScript

This is a simple function, but requires fairly complex typings so let's start
with the minimum typings.

```typescript
const omitByType = (array: any[], type: string): any[] => {
  return array.filter(value => typeof value !== type);
};
```

These typings are an incremental improvement since they at least require the
first argument to be an array and the second argument to be a `string`. This
eliminates entirely invalid arguments, but is not strict enough to catch
a `type` that is not contained within the `array`.

```typescript
// Now invalid...
omitByType("invalid", "object");
omitByType([], Object);

// Still valid...
omitByType([1], "object");
```

So how do we make this last example invalid? The challenge is that the `type`
argument is dependent (conditional) on the type of the `array` contents. This
requires using conditional types. To start, we know we need access to the type
of the `array` argument which can be achieved with a generic.

```typescript
const omitByType = <InputArray extends any[], Type extends string>(
  array: InputArray,
  type: Type
): any[] => {
  return array.filter(value => typeof value !== type);
};
```

This updated definition is equivalent to the original, but now the type
`InputArray` can be referenced in other parts of the function deceleration.
`Type` still allows any string, so let's constrain it based on the type of
`InputArray`.

```typescript
const omitByType = <InputArray extends any[], Type extends InputArray[number]>(
  array: InputArray,
  type: Type
): any[] => {
  return array.filter(value => typeof value !== type);
};
```

This isn't quite correct yet, let's look at an example:

```typescript
// Argument of type '"number"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
omitByType([1], "number");
```

The problem is that `Type` is now inferred as the type `number`, not the string
`"number"`. How do we convert the type `number` to the string `"number"`?
This is the first use case in this example for a conditional type.

```typescript
type TypeToString<Type> = Type extends number ? "number" : "unknown";

type ExampleOne = TypeToString<number>; // "number"
type ExampleTwo = TypeToString<string>; // "unknown"
```

The `TypeToString` type is a conditional type. There are two main aspects to
focus on:

1. This is another use case for the `extends` keyword. It behaves in a similar
   way as it's other uses to constrain types but in this case I like to think of
   it more like a boolean, or question: does `Type` extend `number`?
1. It uses the same syntax as the [ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)
   in JavaScript. The condition `Type extends number` will either be true or false.
   If it's true, it will evaluate to `"number"`, otherwise it will evaluate to
   `"unknown"`.

This syntax is the basis for all conditional types. For me, the mental model
of an `if` statement in JavaScript helps me reason through complex conditional
types. This isn't directly equivalent, but this could be roughly similar to a
function like this in JavaScript.

```javascript
const typeToString = type => {
  if (typeof type === "number") {
    return "number";
  } else {
    return "unknown";
  }
};
```

Or, using the more similar ternary operator syntax:

```javascript
const typeToString = type => (typeof type === "number" ? "number" : "unknown");
```

Again, this isn't identical, but I find comparing conditional types to an `if`
statement in JavaScript the easiest to understand the control flow.

Now that we have the basics of conditional types we can complete the typings.
First, `TypeToString` only handles `number` but we want to handle more types.

```typescript
type TypeToString<Type> = Type extends string
  ? "string"
  : Type extends number
  ? "number"
  : Type extends boolean
  ? "boolean"
  : Type extends undefined
  ? "undefined"
  : Type extends Function
  ? "function"
  : "object";
```

This is fairly verbose, but this would be the equivalent of nesting five `if`
statements, or a large `if...else if...else` statement.

Now that we have this helper, the function can be updated:

```typescript
const omitByType = <
  InputArray extends any[],
  Type extends TypeToString<InputArray[number]>
>(array: InputArray, type: Type): any[] => {
  return array.filter(value => typeof value !== type)
}
```

This no longers a `type` that doesn't exist in the `array`!

```typescript
// Argument of type '"object"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"number"'.
omitByType([1], "object");
```

To recap so far, `InputArray` is a generic that represents the type of `array`.
It also has a constraint that it must be an array enforced with `extends any[]`.
Next, `Type` is also a generic that represents the type of `type`. However, it
has a more complex constraint. First, `InputArray[number]` will return a type
that represents all of the array's values. If the `array` was `[1]` then the
type would be `string`, if `[1, "a", true]` then the type would be 
`number | string | boolean`. However, we need these types as string literals so
we pass this type to the `TypeToString` which uses conditional types to convert
that value to `"string"` or `"number" | "string" | "boolean"`, respectively.
So trying to pass `"object"` will not be allowed (unless the `array` contained
something like `[1, {}]`).

The arguments are now strictly typed, but the return value is still `any[]`.
Let's improve this. We could use `InputArray` which would be more strict, but
it would still contain the type of values that get filtered. So how can the
return value return the same contents excluding the values of the type removed?

First, we need a way to exclude a type from another type. For example, if given
a union `string | number` how can `number` be excluded, or `string`? How can
this example work with any input? This again can be achieved with conditional
types. 

```typescript
type Diff<Types, TypesToExclude> = Types extends TypesToExclude ? never : Types;
type Example1 = Diff<string | number | boolean, string> // number | boolean
type Example2 = Diff<string | number | boolean, number | string> // boolean
type Example3 = Diff<string | number | boolean, object | boolean> // string | number
```

Fortunately, the type `Diff` doesn't need to be defined because TypeScript
[predefines several conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#predefined-conditional-types). One of those is `Exclude` which is identical
to `Diff`.

Now that we can exclude one type from another, the type of the array contents
is the first type argument and the type being excluded is the second type
argument. However, the `Type` generic is now a string (eg: `"number"`) so it
needs to be converted back to a type. For this, let's define yet another
conditional type `StringToType` that is the same as `TypeToString` but reversed.
With that, we have all the pieces we need for a complete example.

```typescript
type TypeToString<Type> = Type extends string
  ? "string"
  : Type extends number
  ? "number"
  : Type extends boolean
  ? "boolean"
  : Type extends undefined
  ? "undefined"
  : Type extends Function
  ? "function"
  : "object";

type StringToType<Str> = Str extends "string"
  ? string
  : Str extends "number"
  ? number
  : Str extends "boolean"
  ? boolean
  : Str extends "undefined"
  ? undefined
  : Str extends "function"
  ? Function
  : object;


const omitByType = <
  InputArray extends any[],
  Type extends TypeToString<InputArray[number]>
>(
  array: InputArray, type: Type
): Array<Exclude<InputArray[number], StringToType<Type>>> => {
  return array.filter(value => typeof value !== type)
}
```

To recap this return value, we are first getting the type of the array contents
using `InputArray[number]` which will return a type, usually a union if the
array contains mixed values (eg: `string | number`). Then, we are converting
the `Type` which is a string literal back to a type (eg: `"string"` -> `string`).
Then, these values are passed to `Exclude` to remove the values of the type
that is being filtered out. Finally, that type is then redefined as an `Array`.
