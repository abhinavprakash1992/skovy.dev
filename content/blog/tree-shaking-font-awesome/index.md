Tree shaking: a word that at first sounds like another one of those convoluted
words used to describe some obscure technology or pattern. After rephrasing as
"dead code elimination," I find to be a strong metaphor for what it actually
describes.

Imagine we're building a large application and over time we begin to add many
packages. Some of these packages provide utility methods, like the
[`intersection`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#intersection) method from
[`lodash`](https://lodash.com/) or [`underscore`](https://underscorejs.org/).
Then there's more packages that provide some UI components like
[Evergreen UI](https://evergreen.segment.com/), [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/),
[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) or one of the many other UI
component packages. And finally, maybe some nice icons like [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Relying on these packages saves a lot of time but if not monitored closely,
the bundle size can start to explode resulting in shipping **many megabytes** of
JavaScript and other assets to a user's browser. It not only takes a long time
to download (especially on slower connections) but now the browser has to parse
and compile all that code which can take a long time (especially on devices
that may not have a lot of resources).

There are a few options. First, it's unlikely a user needs all that code
immediately. So the bundle can be code split into smaller chunks so a user
only has to download the code they need for the current page or feature they
are interacting with. However, even with code splitting, if there are a lot
of dependencies (packages) a user still has to download a lot of code upfront.
But do they _need_ all those dependencies? The simple answer is usually yes.
The first page requires a utility method from `lodash`, and a UI component from
Semantic and an icon from Font Awesome so all those dependencies need to be
loaded. But the more complex and nuanced answer is no.

Across the whole application, maybe only 10% of the utility methods are used,
80% of the UI components and 20% of the icons, not **all** the utility methods,
components and icons.

That means 90% of the utility methods, 20% of the UI components and 80% of the
icon code that is being delivered to users is "dead code." Dead code is code
that is included but never ran. Ideally, this dead code can be eliminated. It
not only consumes more bandwidth and adds latency, it also adds times to all
the decompressing, parsing, compiling and other processing the client has to do
after it's been downloaded. This also means that during build time, it takes longer
to minify, build sourcemaps, compress and any other sort of preprocessing that
takes place at build time.

Eliminating dead code is pretty straightforward in application code that you write.
If a feature or component is unused, delete it. But how does this work with an
external package? Isn't that all or nothing? It's either in `package.json` as a
dependency or it's not?

## ðŸŒ³ Tree Shaking

Since version 2, webpack supports tree shaking. Tree shaking requires the
_packages_ to be properly configured and built to allow tree shaking but it's
performed automatically by webpack in production mode. When it does work, it
looks something like this:

![GIF of an actual tree shaker](./images/tree-shaking.gif)

All of those utilities, components, icons and whatever else isn't used
in the application bundle ("the tree") are entirely removed ("the falling
almonds") so what is left is a much smaller and lighter application bundle ("tree").

Although webpack is configured to perform tree shaking by default, it's often
easy to "break" by using a package with the wrong configuration or
not producing the right output or importing more than actually needed.

### When should tree shaking happen?

Ideally, always. There's no benefit to include dead code. However, as with most
things there are tradeoffs. The first step is to understand _what_ the application
bundle looks like.

#### Visualizing the bundle

Let's look at a basic app that is built with webpack and has a few dependencies
like React, lodash and Font Awesome for icons.

![Screenshot of a basic app](./images/basic-app.png)

There's a simple heading, that renders a single Font Awesome icon
_([see the `basic` source example](https://github.com/skovy/webpack-tree-shaking-demo))_.
When running this example, the output from webpack includes this:

```
WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit (244 KiB).
This can impact web performance.
Assets:
  main.js (819 KiB)

WARNING in entrypoint size limit: The following entrypoint(s) combined asset size exceeds the recommended limit (244 KiB). This can impact web performance.
Entrypoints:
  main (819 KiB)
      main.js


WARNING in webpack performance recommendations:
You can limit the size of your bundles by using import() or require.ensure to lazy load some parts of your application.
For more info visit https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/
```

This is a lot of warnings! What is it actually saying? By default, webpack will
warn if any of the produced output assets exceed 244 Kilobytes in size. Here,
the `main.js` output file was 819 Kilobytes. More than 3x the recommended size!

As the warnings suggest, code splitting could be used to split this single `main.js`
bundle into multiple smaller chunks. However, that doesn't actually solve the
core problem. The core problem is that there likely is a _ton_ of dead code that
is never used in an app that is as simple as this. But where is the dead code?
We could try digging through the webpack output line-by-line, or start inspecting
the packages in `node_modules` but that would be like looking for a needle in a
haystack if you don't know what it is your looking for.

Fortunately we don't have to do that because there's the
[`webpack-bundle-analyzer`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer)
plugin that visualizes the built bundle. It's an invaluable tool to understand
the cost of including a package and determining the biggest opportunities.

To setup the `webpack-bundle-analyzer`, first install it:
`yarn add -D webpack-bundle-analyzer`. Then, include it in the webpack configuration.

```javascript{1-2,8}
const BundleAnalyzerPlugin = require("webpack-bundle-analyzer")
  .BundleAnalyzerPlugin;

module.exports = {
  // Other configuration ...
  plugins: [
    // Other plugins ...
    new BundleAnalyzerPlugin()
  ]
};
```

After running webpack, by default it should open in the browser with a visualization
of the bundle. For the above example app, it will look something like the following.

![Example of the webpack bundle analyzer](./images/webpack-bundle-analyzer.gif)
<span class="image-caption">

</span>

At a closer look, the `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` package accounts for
655 Kilobytes out of the total 818 Kilobytes. 80% of the output bundle is the
icons!

![Font Awesome solid icons](./images/webpack-bundle-analyzer-font-awesome-solid-icons.png)

But in the screenshot of the basic app above there's only one icon. Now you
might start questioning if the icons are _really_ necessary with such a high
cost. How can only the used icons be including?

_Keep in mind that a development build often will produce different output than
the production build. If looking to see \_exactly_ what will be produced in
production make sure to run in `production` `mode`.\_

#### "Enabling" tree shaking with webpack

Enabling here is in quotes because all the options to enable tree shaking are on
by default when working with webpack. However, as mentioned earlier
it's very easy to "break" (disable) tree shaking and include a lot of dead code.

The first step is to ensure webpack is properly configured. The
`optimization.usedExports` setting needs to be enabled.

```javascript{3-5}
module.exports = {
  // Other configuration ...
  optimization: {
    usedExports: true
  }
};
```

Running this in development mode (`mode: "development"`) will produce output
with nearly 1000 comments that look like this:

```javascript
/* unused harmony export faAddressBook */
/* unused harmony export faAlignCenter */
/* unused harmony export ... */
```

So enabling `usedExports` added all these comments highlighting unused exports
but they all still exist. It's the job of the minifier to actually remove these
unused exports. Running this in production mode (`mode: "production"`) will
actually enable `usedExports` and enable the minifier _(which is one of the
many reasons properly configuring the `mode` is important)_. But why are all
the icons still being included? The problem is with how the Font Awesome library
is being used.

## Font Awesome

The following lines will be found looking at the [source](https://github.com/skovy/webpack-tree-shaking-demo/blob/master/basic/src/index.js#L9)
of the basic app.

```javascript
import { library } from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core";
import { fas } from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";

library.add(fas);
```

This is using Font Awesome's [SVG Core](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/advanced/svg-javascript-core)
to add _all_ the solid icons (`fas`) to the library. This means that any icon
can be referenced as a string if using the React Font Awesome components.

```javascript
<FontAwesomeIcon icon="coffee" />
```

As mentioned, tree shaking was actually enabled the entire time but it was "broke"
by the way Font Awesome was setup. How is webpack supposed to determine that we're
only using the `"coffee"` icon but none of the others when _all_ of the `fas` icons
are being imported? It can't.

There are a handful of options. First, the `library.add` can be updated to include
only the icons we know will be used. The above library setup code would look like
this. Now, _only_ the `"coffee"` icon is included which brings the size of code
from the `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` package **down to roughly 1 Kilobyte**
(over a 99% reduction).

```javascript{2,4}
import { library } from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core";
import { faCoffee } from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";

library.add(faCoffee);
```

Great! Problem solved. This might work great to start, but this can quickly
suffer from the common over-including/under-including problem ever-present in
frontend development.

What happens if we decide to add a new icon? This call now needs to be updated
with one more and if it's forgotten that icon won't render (under-included).
What if you remove the usage of the `"coffee"` icon but forget to remove it
from the library (over-included). Are you _sure_ it's not used anywhere else?
This can quickly become a maintenance nightmare in a large codebase. It would be
great to automatically include the exact icons used (not less, not more).

This is where webpack's automated tree shaking shines. To leverage webpack the
usages need to be explicit so it can properly determine what is and isn't used.
With this approach, first remove the `library.add` setup entirely. Now, the icons
need to be explicitly imported. So the above `FontAwesomeIcon` example would
become:

```javascript
import { faCoffee } from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCoffee} />;
```

Now, only the icons that are used are being explicitly imported. If this icon
is removed and it's not used anywhere else it will not longer be bundled. When
new icons are imported, they'll automatically be included.

See the [Font Awesome docs](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/with-the-api/other/tree-shaking)
for more details on working with Font Awesome, tree shaking or options if not
using webpack.
